# Lyft <> Make School Go Course
## Notes 09-13-2018

### Why Go?

* Performance characteristics relative to python (not successful)
* Cannot have type errors
* Single statically linked binary - linux, windows, Mac, Docker - copy/paste the Go binary (gotcha CA certificates, mount or copy the host machines in)
* Lyft - LinkedIn - No. 1 startup
* Releasing python services - no. 1 bug type errors
* Used in micro services
* “Read the spec in a couple of hours, then learn the patterns”
* Replaces JavaScript + Typescript, Flow
* Web server that can handled 100,000’s of requests on one box
* Language agnostic docker files
